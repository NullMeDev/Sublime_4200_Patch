Sublime 4200 Patch — Research Notes and PowerShell Scripting "Demo"
Purpose
This repository is a PowerShell scripting and reverse-engineering learning exercise. It demonstrates how to locate a target executable, back it up, perform deterministic byte edits on a test file, and verify results safely.
It is not intended for, and must not be used for, bypassing licenses, DRM, or End-User License Agreements.

Legal and ethical notice
Modifying commercial software may violate the software’s EULA and local laws.

Do not run byte-patch routines against proprietary binaries you do not own or do not have explicit permission to modify.

This repository is provided for educational purposes only. You are responsible for your own use.

What’s in this repo
SublimeText4200Patch.ps1
PowerShell script demonstrating:

Locating a target file from a default install path

Creating a timestamped backup before any write

Applying deterministic byte replacements

Emitting a verification report and exit code

README.md
You are here.

Safe way to experiment
Use a dummy file that you control. The steps below show the workflow without touching any commercial binaries.

1) Prepare a sandbox
powershell
Copy
Edit
# Create a temp sandbox
$Sandbox = "$env:USERPROFILE\Desktop\SublimePatchSandbox"
New-Item -Force -ItemType Directory -Path $Sandbox | Out-Null

# Create a dummy "exe" to practice on
$Dummy = Join-Path $Sandbox 'DummyApp.exe'
Set-Content -Path $Dummy -Value 'THIS IS A DUMMY BINARY FOR PATCHING PRACTICE' -Encoding Byte
2) Run the script in demo mode
If your script supports a demo or custom path flag, point it at the dummy file. If not, add a parameter like -TargetPath and default to no-op unless explicitly provided.

powershell
Copy
Edit
# Example call pattern
# .\SublimeText4200Patch.ps1 -TargetPath "$Sandbox\DummyApp.exe" -WhatIf
Recommended safety behaviors:

-WhatIf dry-run that prints intended changes

-Backup that writes DummyApp.exe.bak-YYYYmmdd-HHMMSS

Refuse to run unless an explicit -TargetPath to a non-system file is provided

3) Verify results
Your script should output:

Hashes before and after

Count of bytes matched and replaced

Location of backup and logs

Example verification pattern:

powershell
Copy
Edit
# Compute hashes to confirm a change occurred in the dummy file
Get-FileHash "$Sandbox\DummyApp.exe","$Sandbox\DummyApp.exe.bak-*" -Algorithm SHA256
How the script is structured
Discovery: Determine target path. Prefer explicit -TargetPath. Avoid hard-coding vendor install paths.

Safety: Refuse to run without -Backup unless -Force is present. Never write in place without a backup.

Patch logic: Open file as bytes, search for a specific byte sequence, replace with a documented sequence, write atomically.

Verification: Report count of replacements, show pre- and post-hash, and exit non-zero if zero replacements occur.

Logs: Emit a minimal log file to ./logs/patch-YYYYmmdd-HHMMSS.txt.

Parameters to add (recommended)
-TargetPath <string>: Full path to the file you own and intend to modify.

-Backup: Create a timestamped backup before writing.

-WhatIf: Dry-run with no write.

-Verbose: Print detailed steps.

-NoLaunch: Skips launching any application after patching.

-LogPath <string>: Custom log directory.

Example usage patterns
Non-destructive dry-run on a dummy file:

powershell
Copy
Edit
.\SublimeText4200Patch.ps1 -TargetPath "$env:USERPROFILE\Desktop\SublimePatchSandbox\DummyApp.exe" -WhatIf -Verbose
Actual write on a dummy file with backup and log:

powershell
Copy
Edit
.\SublimeText4200Patch.ps1 -TargetPath "$env:USERPROFILE\Desktop\SublimePatchSandbox\DummyApp.exe" -Backup -Verbose
Safety checklist
Run in a sandbox folder first.

Keep backups until you verify behavior.

Never distribute modified commercial binaries.

Do not circumvent licensing, DRM, or usage restrictions.

Respect terms of service and local law.

Contributing
Open an issue with improvements focused on safe scripting, parameterization, and testability.

PRs should include:

A test mode that never touches vendor paths by default

Clear docs and examples using dummy files

Guardrails that prevent accidental writes to system locations
